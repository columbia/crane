Crane
=====

Multi-threaded State Machine Replication

- __Machines:__ three replicas to hold server programs, one client machine.
- __Server machine:__ 12 cores with hyperthreading. The number of cores on
  these server machines is critical, because our
  `crane/eval-container/configs/*.sh` files specified 8~12 as the concurrency
  level. If your servers do not have 24 cores, you had better decrease these
  concurrency levels in these `*.sh` files.
- __Client machine:__ we used a 8 core machine. The number of cores on this
  machine is not critical.
- __OS:__ ubuntu 14.04 64bit.
- __Gcc:__ 4.8.

Install depdendent libraries/tools. Use ubuntu 14.04 hardy, with amd64.

```bash
> sudo apt-get install build-essential
> sudo apt-get install libboost-dev git subversion nano libconfig-dev \
    libevent-dev libsqlite3-dev libdb-dev libboost-system-dev autoconf m4 \
    dejagnu flex bison axel zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libxml-libxml-perl \
    python-pip python-setuptools python-dev libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev wget curl \
    php5-cgi psmisc mencoder sysbench
> sudo pip install numpy
> sudo pip install OutputCheck # (this utility is only required by the testing framework)
```

0. Commands to checkout a brand-new project: Please make sure the absolute
   paths of the "crane" repo are the same on all the machines, including the
   three replica machines and the client machine, because our script uses
   parallel-ssh to run the whole system, so the same crane path setting on all
   these four machines is required.

    ```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/columbia/crane
    > cd $MSMR_ROOT
    > git pull
    ```

1. Set env vars in ~/.bashrc.

    ```bash
    export MSMR_ROOT=<absolute path of crane>
    export XTERN_ROOT=<absolute path of crane/xtern>
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MSMR_ROOT/libevent_paxos/.local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

2. Compile xtern.

    ```bash
    > cd $XTERN_ROOT
    > mkdir obj
    > cd obj
    > ./../configure --prefix=$XTERN_ROOT/install
    > make clean; make; make install
    ```

   Note: for xtern, for everytime you pull the latest project from github,
   please run:

    ```bash
    > cd $XTERN_ROOT/obj
    > make clean; make; make install # <PLEASE RUN MAKE CLEAN EVERYTIME>
    ```

3. Compile libevent_paxos.

    ```bash
    > cd $MSMR_ROOT/libevent_paxos
    > ./mk
    > make clean; make # <PLEASE RUN MAKE CLEAN EVERYTIME>
    TBD. reconfigure IP addresses for Crane.
    ```

4. Install analysis tools. (1) Install valgrind.

    ```bash
    > sudo apt-get install valgrind
    ```

    (2) Install dynamorio.

    ```bash
    > sudo apt-get install cmake doxygen transfig imagemagick ghostscript subversion
    > sudo su root
    > cd /usr/share/
    > git clone https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio.git
    > cd dynamorio && mkdir build && cd build
    > cmake .. && make -j && make drcov
    > cd tools && ln -s $PWD/../drcov.drrun64 .
    > mkdir lib64 && cd lib64 && mkdir release && cd release
    > ln -s $PWD/../../../clients/lib64/release/libdrcov.so .
    > exit # (exit from sudoer)
    ```

    Test dynamorio with the "drcov" code coverage tool. If these commands
    succeed, run `ls -l *.log` in current directory.

    ```bash
    > /usr/share/dynamorio/build/bin64/drrun -t drcov -- ls -l
    > /usr/share/dynamorio/build/bin64/drrun -t drcov -- /bin/bash $XTERN_ROOT/scripts/wrap-xtern.sh ls -l
    ```

5. Install lxc 1.1 (in the host OS)

    ```bash
    > sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-lxc/daily
    > sudo apt-get update
    > sudo apt-get install lxc
    > lxc-create --version
      1.1.0
    ```

   Create a new container named "u1" (if this container does not exist in
   `/var/lib/lxc/u1`)

    ```bash
    > sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n u1 -- -r trusty -a amd64
    ```

   This command will take a few minutes to download all trusty (14.04) initial
   packages. Start the server for the first time, so that we have
   `/var/lib/lxc/u1/config` and `/var/lib/lxc/u1/fstab`.

    ```bash
    > sudo lxc-start -n u1
    > sudo lxc-stop -n u1
    ```

   Config u1 fstab to share memory between the proxy (in host OS) and the
   server process (in container).

    ```bash
    > sudo echo "/dev/shm dev/shm none bind,create=dir" > /var/lib/lxc/u1/fstab
    ````

   Append these lines to `/var/lib/lxc/u1/config`

    ```bash
    # for crane project.
    lxc.network.ipv4 = 10.0.3.111/16
    lxc.console = none
    lxc.tty = 0
    lxc.cgroup.devices.deny = c 5:1 rwm
    lxc.rootfs = /var/lib/lxc/u1/rootfs
    lxc.mount = /var/lib/lxc/u1/fstab
    lxc.mount.auto = proc:rw sys:rw cgroup-full:rw
    lxc.aa_profile = unconfined
    ```

   And restart the container.

    ```bash
    > sudo lxc-start -n u1
    Check the IP.
    > ssh ubuntu@10.0.3.111
    Enter password: "ubuntu"
    ```

   This "ubuntu" user is already a sudoer. Then, you are free to install crane,
   gcc, criu, and other packages in this container.

   Add your own username into the lxc without asking password anymore.  For
   example, in bug03 machine: Generate a private/public key pair, put it into
   your `~/.ssh/`.  Rename the private key to be `~/.ssh/lxc_priv_key`.  Append
   the public key to the u1 container's `~/.ssh/auth..._keys`. Then

    ```bash
    > ssh your_user_name@10.0.3.111 -i ~/.ssh/lxc_priv_key
    ```

   Make sure you can login without entering password.  When you run sudo in the
   u1 container, avoid asking sudo password, append this line to `/etc/sudoers`

    ```bash
    ruigu ALL = NOPASSWD : ALL
    ```

6. Install CRIU (just one way installation work, in the u1 container).

    ```bash
    > cd $MSMR_ROOT/tools/criu/
    > wget http://download.openvz.org/criu/criu-1.6.tar.bz2
    > tar jxvf criu-1.6.tar.bz2
    > sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev protobuf-c-compiler \
        libprotobuf-c0 libprotobuf-c0-dev asciidoc bsdmainutils protobuf-compiler
    > cd criu-1.6
    > make -j
    > sudo make install (the PREFIX directory for criu by default is /usr/local/)
    > which criu
    /usr/local/sbin/criu
    ```

7. Install server applications depending on which one you would like to run.
   Currently we have tested Crane with these servers: mongoose, apache, clamav,
   mediatomb, and mysql.

    ```bash
    > cd $MSMR_ROOT/apps/apache
    > ./mk
    ```

8. Config the IPs of three replicas and one client machine.  The default IPs
   are already set for the RCS@Columbia team, so if you are in this team, you
   don't need to run this command.  You will need three replica machines to
   host servers, and one client machine.  For instance, in our Crane project,
   our client machine is 128.59.21.11, three replicas: (128.59.17.174 (head),
   128.59.17.172, 128.59.17.173).  If your machine IPs are not this setting,
   please run these same commands on all the replica (server) machines:

    ```bash
    > cd $MSMR_ROOT/eval-container
    > ./update-replica-IPs.sh <primary IP> <backup1 IP> <backup2 IP>"
    ```

   For instance, we ran this same command (including the order of IPs) on
   128.59.17.174, 128.59.17.172, 128.59.17.173.

    ```bash
    > ./update-replica-IPs.sh 128.59.17.174 128.59.17.172 128.59.17.173
    ```

9. Run apache with Crane. Run the below commands on your "client" machine (not
   any server machine).

   But, please first make sure the firewalls of our client and replica machines
   are correctly set so that your client machine can indeed sent requests to
   the server machines. To verify this, you can just manually start an apache
   server on each replica (server) machine, and manually launch a "ab" client
   benchmark on your client machine, and see whether ab gets responses
   correctly.

   For instance, these commands are ran on our client machine: 128.59.21.11.

    ```bash
    > cd $MSMR_ROOT/eval-container
    > ./new-run.sh configs/apache.sh no_build joint_sched 1
    ```

   Run the apache un-replicated nondeterministic execution.

    ```bash
    > ./new-run.sh configs/apache.sh no_build orig 1
    ```

   Run the apache with proxy (paxos) only.

    ```bash
    > ./new-run.sh configs/apache.sh no_build proxy_only 1
    ```

   Run the apache with DMT (Parrot) only.

    ```bash
    > ./new-run.sh configs/apache.sh no_build xtern_only 1
    ```

   Below are one sample output from the ab server, if you ran any one of the
   above "new-run.sh" commands.

    ```bash
